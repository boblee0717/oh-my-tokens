## 2026-05-26: Private key accidentally committed in manifest `key` field

- commit `2610be7` (openDSFlashV4) added a PKCS#8 **private key** to `manifest.json`'s `"key"` field, instead of a public key.
- Fixed in `246aeb9` (claudeOpus): replaced with correct SubjectPublicKeyInfo public key. Extension ID changed from `pgahg...` to `obmkh...`.
- **Risk assessment**: Minimal — the key was random/gen'd for ID calculation only, unrelated to any account/credential. The leaked key corresponds to the **now-deprecated** extension ID (`pgahg...`), which nobody uses. No force-push rewrite performed per project decision.
- **Avoidance**: When generating a Chrome `manifest.json` `"key"`, use `openssl rsa -pubout -outform DER | base64` (public key only), not `openssl pkcs8 -topk8` (private key).
